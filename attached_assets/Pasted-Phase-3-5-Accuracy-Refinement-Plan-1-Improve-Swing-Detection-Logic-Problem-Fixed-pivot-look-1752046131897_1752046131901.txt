Phase 3.5 – Accuracy Refinement Plan
1. 📐 Improve Swing Detection Logic
✅ Problem: Fixed pivot lookback (e.g. 20 bars) may miss cleaner swing points in volatile or flat conditions.

🔧 Solution:

Make swing high/low detection dynamic:

Use ATR to define lookback window adaptively (e.g. tighter in low-volatility, wider in high-volatility zones)

Or use a percentage range from recent price for pivot validation

📊 Impact: Reduces false swings → cleaner BOS/CHOCH chain

2. 📏 BOS/CHOCH Thresholding
✅ Problem: Minor breakouts sometimes falsely trigger BOS or CHOCH

🔧 Solution:

Add buffer threshold to BOS/CHOCH validation:

e.g. Only count BOS if close breaks swing high by 0.2–0.5%

Optionally validate BOS/CHOCH only if candle closes above/below with volume

📊 Impact: Filters out noise, improves structural reliability

3. 🧠 BOS/CHOCH Chain Validity
✅ Problem: BOS/CHOCH flips back and forth during chop

🔧 Solution:

Track a minimum distance from last BOS before allowing opposite CHOCH

Lock structure direction for X bars unless major reversal detected (trend stability)

Add structure confidence score based on trend duration

📊 Impact: Prevents overreaction to minor reversals

4. 📦 Fair Value Gap (FVG) Enhancements
✅ Problem: All valid FVGs treated equally

🔧 Solution:

Assign score to FVG based on:

Gap size (larger gaps = stronger imbalance)

Occurrence near structure change (CHOCH/FVG combo = more reliable)

Recency of FVG

Prune old or filled FVGs

📊 Impact: Cleaner proximity logic and fewer false FVG matches

5. 📉 Trend Confirmation Filters
✅ Problem: BOS/CHOCH doesn’t always mean price will continue

🔧 Solution:

Confirm structure with:

EMA slope across timeframes

Price > or < VWAP or midline

Strong candle momentum (long bodies, volume spike)

📊 Impact: Confirms market intention behind BOS

6. 📊 Backtest Accuracy Feedback Loop
✅ Problem: No audit of signal quality over time

🔧 Solution:

Add backend tracker:

Record when BOS/CHOCH is generated

Track future movement vs SL/TP levels

Auto-tag outcome (hit TP, hit SL, neutral)

📊 Impact: Use real results to optimize thresholds over time
